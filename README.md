An analysis with EXCEL and SQL and a presentation created with PowerPoint and Tableau for a hypothetical Rockbuster Video

Rockbuster Stealth LLC movie rental company management plans to keep pace with the competition from streaming services by launching an online video rental service using its existing movie license.
Rockbuster is seeking data-driven insights to create a successful launch strategy. 
To answer the questions posed by the different departments, the data should be queried using SQL. 
The results of the analysis will be presented to Rockbuster management, so visualizations should be created so the data can be presented in an easy-to-consume manner.
